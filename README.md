# CrustyJacket

The goal of this project is to test if/how Rust and a variety of libraries in that ecosystem can be used to build an application for displaying and interacting with 3D jacket structures.

Note that this is a test project primarily made for learning Rust. I am not a professional developer and the code will undoubtedly be clumsy and full of bugs. If you're interested in the project that's great, but you should probably lower your expectations :).
